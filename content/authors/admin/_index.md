I am a PhD student of statistics at the University of Iceland, but most of my time is spent listening to 90s alternative guitar rock and thinking about what a perfect musician Joanna Newsom is.

I'm can't be bothered to tell you more about me at the moment so here are some pictures of my dog, Toby. 

When I finally write something about myself you'll be the first to know! I promise!
